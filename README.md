# Resizing Images
## Tool for resizing images of various formats to different sizes horizontally and vertically. 

The goal of the project is research and apply different resizing methodologies. 

Methods used:
- Nearest Neighbor (Implemented)
- BiLinear (TODO)
- BiCubic Interpolation (TODO)

The approach taken is to first convert any compressed format to Bitmap and then work with the pixel matrix to then interpolate the output image data.
